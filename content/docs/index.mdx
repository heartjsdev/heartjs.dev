Welcome to Heart.js! It's a modular TypeScript starter that brings together **Hono, Expo, AI SDK, React, and TanStack Router** without tightly coupling your frontend and backend into a single runtime.

Full-stack frameworks like SvelteKit and Next.js are excellent for building connected apps. However, adding a mobile app or an external API can become complicated because the frontend and backend are often too intertwined.

Heart.js is the answer to this problem. It establishes a clean separation where each layer can share code, types, and structure without obstructing the others.

## What's Inside?

Heart.js provides a curated collection of leading web development technologies, ready to be composed into your ideal stack.

### Key Principles

Heart.js is built on a few core ideas:

| Principle          | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular**        | Each part of your stack (API, web, mobile) is independent, making it easy to manage, scale, or replace.                                  |
| **Type-Safe**      | With TypeScript at its core, you can share types between your backend and frontend, ensuring end-to-end type safety.                     |
| **No Lock-in**     | The setup uses the official CLIs for each technology (`hono init`, etc.), so you're not tied to a proprietary system. It’s just tools that play well together. |
| **Developer-First** | An interactive CLI, modern tooling, and optional integrations are designed to make the development experience fun and productive.            |
