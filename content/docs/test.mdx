Get started by running a single command. The interactive CLI will guide you through selecting the components you need for your project.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
-   **Docker**: Optional, but required if you plan to use the integrated database services.

## Create a New Project

You can create a new Heart.js project using your preferred package manager. The CLI automatically detects and uses the package manager you invoke it with.

```bash
# npm
npm create heartjs@latest

# yarn
yarn create heartjs

# pnpm
pnpm create heartjs@latest

# bun
bun create heartjs@latest
```

### Interactive Setup

After running the command, the CLI will prompt you to configure your project. You can name your project and select the components you want to include.

```bash
$ npm create heartjs@latest
